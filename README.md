## TODO

- [ ] Server (35pt.)
- [ ] Client/Player (35pt.)
- [x] GUI (15pt.)
- [ ] Exception Handling (15pt.)
- [ ] Bonus (15pt.)

## Hint

You need to first decouple the view and controller, divide the controller into two components: **client** and **server**, and then use **socket** to communicate between the two components to complete the basic functions.
